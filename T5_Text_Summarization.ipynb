            "By . Hayley O'keeffe . PUBLISHED: . 05:23 EST, 31 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 31 October 2013 . When artist Alan Dodd was asked by friends to paint a mural on a blank 50-foot-long wall at their home he transformed it into an optical illusion. Friendly faces behind windows and lifelike archways leading to landscapes are painted onto the cottage, in Eye, Suffolk. And the images give an illusion of a make-believe world within. Nationally-renowned artist Alan Dodd stands with the unusual mural that he painted on the side of a friend's home in Eye, Suffolk . The largest painting in the Eye mural is a blacksmith's forge, which takes in the skyline features of the town's church and castle. Quirky characters and also animals feature on other parts of the house side. More... The picture you never thought you'd see... Anna Wintour eating a burger and fries! Artist gives Vogue editor and her fashion friends a calorie-laden makeover . Rare Italian 'San Gennaro' collection of gems said to be worth more than England's crown jewels goes on display in Rome . Sex slaves, public executions - yet glorious art like this: A majestic Roman eagle, newly unearthed in London, and a gripping account of life in AD100 . These include rabbits and chickens, and a captivating cat which stares from a painted window. Many of the images were inspired by the history of botany and horticulture. In one window Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus, who was the first person to categorise plants, sits writing with a quill pen. A parrot watches him from an ornate perch and an old fashioned wig sits beside him. Mr Dodd, who was taught by pop art pioneer David Hockney, paints the work, which he says is a homage to the market town's heritage . Mr Dodd adds the finishing touches to the masterpiece, which he says will benefit from being on a wall that stays out of the sun . The finished mural is incredibly detailed and Mr Dodd spent 55 hours up a ladder during the painting process . In another view influential British horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll reclines in her rocking chair, looking into the secluded garden through the painted curtains. Mr Dodd's mural also features a red Royal Mail letterbox, adding even more colour to the finished work. The artist spent 55 days up a ladder to create images at the property in Eye, Suffolk. He says the stunning finished product is a homage to the heritage of the market town. In another detail from the mural an elderly lady reclines in a rocking chair next to a vase of flowers, while in a second window an intricate vase is displayed . Mr Dodd, 71, who lives in Weston, Suffolk, said: 'It was just a blank, long wall. 'You would not believe what a difference it has made to the space. 'The wall is about 650 square feet so it would not have been feasible to paint the whole thing so we decided to paint parts of it.' He added: 'The mural will also really benefit from being on a wall which is often away from direct sunlight.' Mr Dodd trained at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1960s and was taught by influential pop art pioneer David Hockney. He now designs and paints murals for a living. The artist has used his skills to work on a number of important projects, including the Pompeiian ceiling decoration in the New Picture Room at Sir John Soane's Museum in London.\n",

            "Jailed: Joshua Sadler, 21, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting dangerous driving . The mother of a teenager who was killed when a friend crashed his car just four days after passing his test has spoken of her shock after the driver was jailed for only 12 months. Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control of his silver Renault Clio on a 60mph country road and smashed into a tree, killing front seat passenger Mikey Maguire, 19. Sadler had previously been convicted of a . string of serious motoring offences and twice banned from the road . before he even had a licence. He was seen on the night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns and showing off in a car park. Sadler . pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced . to 12 months in jail and banned him from driving for five years. Afterwards Mr Maguireâs mother Allison Jarman, 43, described the sentence as an âinsultâ. She said: 'When I was in court my head was in my hands and at one point I couldnât even listen to what was happening. 'I . expected the sentence to be low because I have been doing a lot of . research online but when I heard it was 12 months it felt like a slap in . the face. 'Nothing can . bring Mikey back but 12 months for my sonâs life is shocking. I was . absolutely speechless, he will be out in three months. 'Mikey and Joshua had known each other for years but I was under the impression that they werenât close any more. 'He . had always been a bit of a troublemaker and had previous convictions . for driving offences. I always said he would end up hurting someone one . day, I just didnât expect it to be my son.' The fatal crash happened on Huntick Road, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, Dorset, on February 8 last year. Sadler, from Poole, lost control of his . car on a bend before it ploughed down a grass bank and struck the tree. Mr Maguire was pronounced dead at the scene. Victim: Mikey Maguire pictured on on holiday with his mother Allison, who described the sentence as an 'insult' to her son's memory . Sadler had previously been disqualified from driving after being convicted of two counts of aggravated vehicle taking. He appeared in court for one of the counts and driving without a licence and insurance in July 2010. In both incidents he lost control and caused more than Â£5,000 damage to one of the vehicles. Les Smith, defending, read out a statement from Sadler to Bournemouth Crown Court in which he expressed âregret and sorrowâ for the Mr Maguireâs death. He added: 'The incident haunts me every day and will do for the rest of my life. Nothing that is said or done to me can make me feel any worse.' As well as being jailed Sadler was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test at the end of the ban.\n",

            "By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 12:51 EST, 20 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:58 EST, 20 February 2014 . We swear far more on Twitter than in the real world, researchers have found. A major analysis of 51 million English language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse. Researchers were also able to rank the most popular words, finding f**k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets. The most popular curse words on Twitter: Researchers examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts . People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed, the researchers found. They also found people swore earlier in the week - Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume. 'Itâs a sizable fraction of the words we use,' Wenbo Wang, a PhD researcher at Wright State University who led the study, told Fastco. 'On average, one tweet out of 13 tweets will contain at least one cursing word,' 'Because of social media, people donât see each other. 'They can say things they wouldnât say in the physical world.' The team at Wright State University examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. They found that we curse more on Twitter than in real life, but tend to use only a few words. 'We found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15% on Twitter, and 7.73% of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words,' the team wrote in their paper, which was presented this week at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. 'We also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90% of all the cursing occurrences.' The team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on Twitter. 'Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our),' the researchers wrote. Lack of imagination: The top seven curse words accounted for 90% of all curses, the researchers found . 'On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network.' They also classified the cursing, and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger, joy, sadness, love, and thankfulness. 'Based on the classification results, we found that cursing on Twitter was . most closely associated with two negative emotions: sadness and anger. 'However, curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love.' Other insights in the paper involved timing, location, gender, and level of influence of the tweeters. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime, and Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume. Researcher say the hour before we go to sleep is when we are most likely to swear in a tweet . They also found user swore less when talking directly to another user. 'Our study of the relation between cursing and message types suggests that users perform self-censorship when they talk directly to other users. 'We find that users do curse more in relaxed environments, but the differences across different environments are very small, partly due to the fact that Twitter messages are posted in virtual digital world. They also found men tended to swear more. 'Men curse more than women, men overuse some curse words different from what women use and vice versa, and both men and women are more likely to curse in the same-gender contexts. Curses rises late at night just before people go to bed . A case of the Mondays? The study revealed we swear more in the early part of the week .\n",

            "By . Associated Press . Many of the exhausted dogs that have been in . search of victims of the deadly mudslide that buried a mountainside Washington . community will take a two-day break as the official death toll rose from 18 to 21. The dogs can lose their sensing ability if overworked in the cold and rain. âThe . conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to . take care of the dogs,â said Kris Rietmann, a spokeswoman for the team . working on the eastern portion of the slide, which hit March 22 about 55 . miles northeast of Seattle and is one of the deadliest in U.S. history. Needed rest: Rescue dog Tryon, muddied from the day's work, stands with his handler near the west side of the mudslide on Highway 530 near mile marker 37  in Arlington, Washington. Dogs like Tryon have been given a two-day break from work because days of intense searching can dull their senses . Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that arrived more recently will continue working. Fifteen of the victims have been identified by the Snohomish County medical examiner, and six have yet to be identified, Biermann said. Another four bodies were found in the debris field on Sunday, but they won't be added to the official count until the medical examiner receives the bodies. Biermann said 30 people remain missing. Authorities have said the task of finding and identifying victims from the debris field has been extremely challenging, and not all may ultimately be recovered. Dirty job: Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, waits to be decontaminated via hose. He's one of many that helped uncover four more bodies over the weekend . Slog: Periods of rain and wind have hampered efforts for days and constant exposure to the conditions can hurt dogs' ability to sense victims . Holding strong: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. While some dogs will be given a break, others will continue working in the unforgiving conditions over the next two days . Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, strolls the staging area at the west side of the mudslide . FEMA dogs that were brought in more recently will continue to work as the local rescue dogs that have been searching for days will get a break . Crews have completed a makeshift road that will link one side of the debris field to the other, significantly aiding the recovery operation. They have also been working to clear mud and debris from the highway, leaving piles of gooey muck, splintered wood and housing insulation on the sides of the road. Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions, including septic tanks, gasoline and propane containers. When rescuers and dogs leave the site, they are hosed off by hazardous materials crews. The slide dammed up the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing water to pool up on the east side. The river cut a new channel through the mud, but the rain has raised the water level nearly a foot, Rietmann said. In at least one place, the water level got so high that it covered areas that have already been searched, said Tim Pierce, leader of Washington Task Force 1, a search-and-rescue team. âAt this point, there's no point in searching (that area) again until the water drops back down,â he said. Rescuers should get some relief soon. Conditions were improving Sunday, and mainly dry weather is forecast Monday through Wednesday in western Washington. Devotion: The congregation of the Glad Tidings Assembly of God church in Darrington sings Sunday during morning church services . Staying strong: Much of the music and speaking at Sunday's service was devoted to reaction to the deadly mudslide that hit the nearby community of Oso . The size of the debris field is also smaller than initially thought, officials said Sunday. After review and analysis, geologists have determined it is about 300 acres â just under half the size of an earlier projection of 1 square mile. Away from the whirring chain saws and roaring bulldozers, many residents of nearby Darrington sought comfort in church services. âI can only compare it to a hot, hearty meal after a very cold day,â said Slava Botamanenko, who works at the hospital in Arlington. He said he spent two nights there to be sure he was available for work after the mudslide blocked the road. All week, a steady stream of people has stopped in to pray at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God on the edge of town, said Lee Hagen, the senior pastor. âAt a time like this, everybody knows they've got to have God's help,â he said. Tough times: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. Soggy conditions have made the search effort difficult for both humans and dogs . Remembering what's important: An American flag pulled from the debris hangs in the staging area . Reaching out: Randy Fay, a volunteer rescue technician with Snohomish County's SnoHawk 10 rescue helicopter, helps Jetty Dooper, from the Netherlands . Terrible conditions: Search and rescue teams walk through a field of mud on a path of plywood at the west side of the mudslide . Evidence of tragedy: Assorted broken debris sits on a muddy suitcase pulled from the scene at the west side of the mudslide on Sunday . In it together: A sheriff chaplain offers a few words to a rescue worker as he enters the decontamination tent area . Firefighters navigate through downed trees as they carry shovels in the muck on Sunday . Country singer Susie McEntire, sister of Reba, performed for the congregation Sunday, crooning: âYou'll get through this and you'll break new ground.â At the St. John Mary Vianney Catholic church a few blocks away, Father Tim Sauer said: âBless our communities, bless our people, bless our valley.â The Rev. Owen Couch, a chaplain for the fire district in Darrington, said he's worried about the first responders. âMy concern is when this slows down and they're not going full tilt, and they have time to kind of reflect on what they've seen and what they've done,â he said. âThat's when the critical incident stress starts to kick in.â Steve Huot, lead chaplain for the Arlington Fire Department, said he is seeing people in various states. Some are in shock, while others have begun to grasp the reality of the disaster. Many are exhausted. âIt's more about listening right now. You need to encourage them and maybe change their focus to staying busy for the group, for the team,â he said.

            "By . Emily Crane . and Aap . A man has handed himself in almost 12 hours after allegedly running from the scene of a fatal car accident during a police chase northwest of Melbourne. Police were responding to reports that three men and a woman wearing balaclavas were allegedly trying to rob a ticket machine at Macedon railway station, about 70km from Melbourne, just before 5am on Saturday. The four people took off in a sedan and police gave chase but a short time later, officers found the car had rolled on a nearby bend. Scroll down for video . A man has handed himself in almost 12 hours after allegedly running from the scene of a fatal car accident during a police chase northwest of Melbourne . One man was killed after being ejected from the vehicle and police saw two men fleeing into dense bush, Nine News reports. Police arrested a 27-year-old Sunbury woman at the scene and she is under police guard at Royal Melbourne Hospital. 'The fact they left their friends, one dead and one injured, and fled off into the bush probably speaks volumes about their character,' Assistant Commissioner Jack Blayney said of the two men who fled. Police were responding to reports of an alleged robbery at Macedon railway station, about 70km from Melbourne, just before 5am on Saturday . The four people took off in a sedan and police gave chase but a short time later, officers found the car had rolled on a nearby bend . A Sunbury man, 30, was later arrested on a roadside at nearby Gisborne about 9.45am on Saturday. He had minor injuries and remains in police custody. But police were still looking for the second man until Saturday evening when a 32-year-old from Diggers Rest showed up at Gisborne Police Station. He was being held for questioning. Investigators believe the car lost control in wet conditions and clipped a tree. 'If the police are indicating to people that they should pull over, they should pull over. It's not worth risking your life, the life of your friends, the life of innocent members of the public and also the lives of police officers for such trivial matters,' Blayney said.

            "By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Crews are battling to clean up a major U.S. shipping channel in Texas after a barge carrying almost one million gallons of thick, sticky oil collided with a ship in Galveston Bay near Houston, threatening an important shorebird habitat. No timetable has been set to reopen the waterway after nearly 170,000 gallons of tar-like oil spilled on Saturday, creating a huge oil slick. But on Monday, more help was being called in to contain the spill and protect wildlife. A barge carrying about 900,000 gallons of the heavy oil collided with a ship in the busy Houston Ship Channel, spilling as much as a fifth of its cargo into one of the world's busiest waterways for moving petrochemicals, according to the Coast Guard. Oil had been detected 12 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, and as many as 60 vessels were either waiting to get in or out. The Coast Guard - which called it a 'significant spill' - said it expected to deploy more containment booms on Monday, with 24 vessels working to skim the oil. Scroll down for video . Clean up efforts: Vessels work to skim oil off the surface of the water after 168,000 gallons of oil spilled into Galveston Bay, Texas on Saturday . Damage: United States Coast Guardsmen inspect oil washing ashore along Boddeker Road in Galveston as clean up efforts get underway . The cleanup effort comes exactly 25 years after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker slammed into the Bligh Reef in Alaska and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. Two decades on and the coast remains polluted by the oil. Environmental groups said the Texas spill occurred at an especially sensitive time. The channel in Texas City, about 45 miles southeast of Houston, has important shorebird habitat on both sides, and tens of thousands of wintering birds are still in the area. 'The timing really couldn't be much worse since we're approaching the peak shorebird migration season,' said Richard Gibbons, conservation director of the Houston Audubon Society. He noted that just to the east is the Bolivar Flats Shorebird Sanctuary, which attracts 50,000 to 70,000 shorebirds to shallow mud flats that are perfect foraging habitat. Fewer than 10 oiled birds had been found and recovered for transfer to a wildlife rehabilitation center as of Sunday afternoon, according to the Coast Guard. The Texas General Land Office has also deployed a bird rehabilitation trailer in the area for quick response. 'This is a significant spill,' Capt. Brian Penoyer, commander of the Coast Guard at Houston-Galveston, said. But he said the emptying the remaining oil from the barge on Sunday, a process known as lightering as contents are transferred to other vessels, was an important step and eliminated the risk of additional oil spilling. Victim: A dead oil-covered bird is shown on the Eastern end of Galveston as environmental groups fear the effect on wildlife . Fears: A seagull lands in heavy crude oil washing up on East Beach. The spill occurred near an important shorebird habitat, environmental groups said . Covered: Almost 170,000 gallons of thick, sticky oil were spilled on Saturday. Pictured, the oil covers the shoreline in Galveston . Mess: People photograph oil washing ashore in Galveston on Sunday as crews place a protective boom along the shoreline . More than 380 people - 'and we've ordered more,' Penoyer said - along with a fleet of oil-retrieving skimmers and other vessels were deploying some 60,000 feet of containment booms around environmentally sensitive areas worked to mitigate the damage. Some black tar-like globs, along with a dark line of a sticky, oily substance, could be detected along the shoreline of the Texas City dike, a 5-mile-long jetty that juts into Galveston Bay across from a tip of Galveston Island. 'That is the consistency of what the cargo looks like,' Jim Guidry, executive vice president of Houston-based Kirby Inland Marine Corp., said when the substance was described to him at a news conference. Guidry said the company - the nation's largest inland barge company and owner of the barge that spilled the oil - was taking responsibility for the costs. 'We're very concerned. We're focused on cleaning up,' he said. The barge has been moved to a shipyard and is no longer at the scene of the spill, according to a statement Sunday evening from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office. Two cruise ships were allowed to travel through the incident area \"to minimize inconvenience to the thousands of passengers aboard and limit economic impacts from the spill,\" according to a statement Sunday evening from the Coast Guard. Queue: The Royal Caribbean Navigator of the Seas and the Carnival Magic sit idle with dozens of other ships off the coast of Galveston. At least 33 vessels, including two cruise ships, are waiting to enter the Houston Ship Channel from the Gulf of Mexico . Race against time: Oil containment booms cut across a sand bar covered with birds on Pelican Island. So far about 10 birds have been killed . Fight: Crews place a protective boom along the seashore near Port Bolivar in Port Bolivar as dozens of ships help in the clean up effort on Sunday . Struggle: Workers try to move an oil containment boom from the shore area on the Eastern end of Galveston near the ship channel . Close to shore: Oil containment booms are spread out in Galveston Harbor after the collision spilled nearly 170,000 gallons of thick oil . The channel, part of the Port of . Houston, typically handles as many as 80 vessels daily. But it will . remain closed for a third day Monday, and the Coast Guard said there was . no timetable on when it may reopen. If . the bottleneck of vessels in the Gulf eases in a day or so, there . likely wouldn't be much impact on fuel prices. But a more prolonged . backup could push up prices briefly, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of . energy consultancy Jim Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago. The . contents of the torn tank, equal to about 4,000 barrels, were lost or . displaced into other vacant areas of the barge. Penoyer said currents, . tides and wind were scattering the spill. 'Containment was never a possibility in this case,' he said. The Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are still investigating what happened. 'It will take quite a bit of time, given the complexity of the vessels and a very busy waterway,' Penoyer said. Destruction: Marine fuel oil can be seen leaking from a partly submerged barge into the Houston Ship Channel after colliding with a ship on Saturday . Slick: A vessel surrounded by a sheen on the water near the Port of Galveston. The company of the barge carrying the oil is paying for clean up costs . Disaster: The spill comes on the 25th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill. In this April 17, 1989 photo, a worker makes his way across the polluted shore of Block Island, Alaska after more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled . Heartbreaking: In this April 9, 1989 photo, a local fisherman inspects a dead California gray whale following the spill in Alaska . Also closed was the Texas City dike, a popular fishing spot that goes out into the Gulf for a few miles. Lee Rilat, 58, owns Lee's Bait and Tackle, the last store before the access road to the dike, which was blocked by a police car on a breezy, overcast Sunday. If it weren't for the spill, Rilat's business would be hopping. 'This would be the first spring deal, the first real weekend for fishing,' he said. The spill site is 700 yards offshore from the Texas City dike. A crane and several small boats could be seen at the cleanup site, and dozens of trucks were at a staging area along the beach. The captain of the 585-foot ship, Summer Wind, reported the spill on Saturday afternoon. Six crew members from the tow vessel, which was going from Texas City to Port Bolivar, Texas, were injured, the Coast Guard said.\n",

            "By . Ashley Collman . Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity. In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video . New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's roomÂ  on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints . The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday.Â  Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007 . Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake . Rumors that a new player might be added . to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions . were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black . female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times . that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the . first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels . also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was . initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He . saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their . performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for . the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels . says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of . the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them . into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show . for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady . Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do . with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no . sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.\n",

            "By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 13:37 EST, 15 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:21 EST, 16 February 2013 . A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a 'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticised Katie Tantum, 33, for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Tantum was a trainee on Â£42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm 'just stopped bothering' with her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Tantum is suing law firm Travers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant . Miss Tantum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is suing for loss of earnings. Helen Croke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Tantumâs progress that the Cambridge graduate 'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents. She said: 'I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. 'It was a not a good review. Clearly corporate wasnât a good seat for her.' When comparing Miss Tantum's review with that of another trainee, Ms Croke said it was like 'comparing apples and oranges.' She said Miss Tantum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. She added: 'Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares. 'Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect. 'I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katieâs work on transactions were poor. 'When youâre in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee. 'I canât believe she didnât know she was making mistakes.' Miss Tantum's lawyer accused Ms Croke of launching a 'full frontal attack' on Miss Tantum in her witness statement after she said the plaintiff 'gave the impression she didnât want to do what she was doing'. The tribunal also heard that Ms Croke was 'very critical' of Miss Tantum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.30am because she did not feel well. David Massarella, representing Miss Tantum, said: 'You made a comment on her leaving work in the middle of the night. 'She knows she left at 6.30am. She knows that because she went to Pret, which does not open until then.' Ms Croke denies criticising Miss Tantum's behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. In her witness statement she said: 'I told my supervisor, Mahesh Varia, who seemed supportive and thanked me for telling him. Miss Tantum said she was criticised for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night . 'But Mr Mahesh just stopped bothering with me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating.' Miss Tantum, who is fluent in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was âabsolutely committed to returning to the firmâ. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that âno one put their hand upâ for her. She said: 'I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.' The firm's head of real estate told the hearing he was 'delighted' to find out Miss Tantum was pregnant. Julian Bass said: 'Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasnât surprised because of her age and so on. 'I was genuinely delighted.' But despite a glowing review from Mr Bass, Miss Tantum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees. He said: 'She was a strong contender in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skills which could make her a good real estate lawyer.' The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by 'mute' partners when discussing Miss Tantumâs future at the firm. Ms Croke said: 'I donât believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Travers Smith.' The hearing continues.\n",

            "By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 10:51 EST, 17 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 18 September 2013 . A businessman who took a gamble on a little known company in 1980 has been revealed as one of several billionaires who made their fortune thanks to Warren Buffett. Stewart Horejsi's family welding business had been struggling to fight off competition when he first bought 40 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $265 each. Friends had told him about Buffett, the company's chairman who he went on to model his life on, in a move that has propelled him up the rich list. Growth fund: Stewart Horejsi is now worth more than $1 billion thanks to an investment with Warren Buffett . The 75-year-old father of two is now a billionaire, with a bigger stake in the profitable company than that owned by Bill Gates, the world's richest person - and Buffett's bridge partner. Mentor: Billionaire Warren Buffett inspired Horejsi . He has 4,300 Class A shares of the Nebraska company, giving him a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg. However, the modest man has never appeared on an international wealth ranking. Horejsi's path to his billion-dollar empire began with a modest investment. In 1980 he bought 40 shares in Berkshire for $265 each - an initial investment of $10,600. Two weeks later he bought 60 more shares at $295 each and, a month later, spent $66,000 buying 200 shares at $330. This morning, the 4,300 shares he accumulated in Berkshire since 1980 were valued at $746 million. 'I kept running the [family] business, but I just kept buying Berkshire. I canât really believe I put so much into one issue, though,' he said. Horejsi was so impressed with Buffett, he has followed several of the billionaire philanthropist's moves. In an interview with Wealth Estates he . said: 'Buffett is one of two people Iâve met in my life that within 60 . seconds of listening to him, you can feel an aura of integrity around . him. Itâs very comforting.' When he was 43 Kansas welding supplier Horejsi took a year off to focus on his next move. He read books such as Adam Smith's The Money Game which helped he realize his best opportunity was to invest outside the welding world. 'It was a profitable business, but . companies took their money and bought more trucks,' Horejsi said. 'The . competition just grew.' Horejsi turned his attention to Berkshire, buying up more shares every time the market dipped. Island living: Horejsi has used part of his fortune to buy a luxury villa in Barbados . Low key: Despite his billions Horejsi has never appeared on international wealth rankings and says his biggest extravagance is flying by private jet . As well as investing in Buffett's venture, he also emulates the billionaire's lifestyle in other ways and has remained grounded, living a low-key life between his American homes . and a Barbados villa that has a 300-year-old palm tree in the front yard, according to Forbes. He admitted to the Phoenix Business Journal that his greatest extravagance was flying by private jet, but the Kansas University graduate remains committed to supporting his old campus and other education charities. Despite being a shrewd investor, Horejsi measures his own success in more personal terms, saying: 'If the people you want to love you, love you, then you are a success.'\n",

            "A gunman in an Afghan National Army uniform and another man shot dead two NATO soldiers at a combat outpost in southern Afghanistan Thursday, authorities said. The dead soldiers were Americans, according to Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi, the district chief in Kandahar province, where the shooting happened. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, however, did not immediately specify the service members' nationalities. Thursday's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that U.S. troops mistakenly burned Qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage, protests, and violence across Afghanistan. All three shootings were carried out by men in official clothing. Four Americans were killed in the earlier attacks. If the troops killed Thursday are indeed American, that would bring the death toll from the three attacks to six. A top U.S. lawmaker last month cited at least 42 attacks by Afghan security forces on their international allies in the past five years. Rep. Buck McKeon, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said 39 of the attacks were by members of the Afghan National Security Force and three were by contractors. \"Though less than 1% of Afghan forces and security guards have attacked coalition forces, this is 42 attacks too many and the new process must do better,\" he said at a congressional hearing. Most attackers were acting on their own, rather than being puppets of insurgent groups, defense officials testified. France suspended its operations in Afghanistan after four French soldiers were killed by Afghan counterparts in eastern Kapisa province in January. That shooting came after another Afghan soldier killed two French soldiers in December. \"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,\" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the shootings. Coalition forces responding to Thursday's incident killed the two gunmen, said Capt. Justin Brockhoff, an ISAF spokesman. Sarhadi said one gunman was an Afghan National Army soldier and the other, dressed in civilian clothes, was a teacher who formerly ran literacy courses for Afghan army soldiers. Afghan civilians are sometimes used to teach Afghan soldiers English to improve their ability to work alongside ISAF. It appeared that the teacher had been planning the attack for at least a year, Sarhadi said, because officials found pictures and other documents related to the Taliban among his possessions. U.S. officials have called the Quran burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the Qurans and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions. U.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the burning. Still, gunmen have targeted U.S. troops in the days following the burning. A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform killed two American soldiers at a base in eastern Nangarhar province early last week. Over the weekend, two senior U.S. officers were gunned down inside the heavily secure Afghan Interior Ministry when a junior intelligence officer turned his gun on them. The gunman, who had been fired by the ministry but recently rejoined as a driver, is still on the loose. The incident prompted the United States to pull military advisers and embedded civilians from Afghan ministries, and France announced it was temporarily withdrawing all of its public officials in Afghan institutions to ensure their safety. The unrest following the Quran burning has left at least 41 people dead, including the two deaths Thursday, and hundreds more wounded. At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in an explosion Monday near the front gate of the ISAF base at Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan. There were no NATO casualties in the bombing. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning. In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, Afghan and U.S. authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, and the resulting blasts wounded seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday the unrest and targeting of Americans has gotten \"out of hand\" and needs to stop. The Obama administration feels the Afghans have not done enough to stem the violence, according to a senior U.S. official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions, but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. \"We are not going to settle for what has happened to our troops in recent days,\" the official said. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, maintained Sunday that the Afghan security forces have given their lives to control the demonstrations and protect U.S. installations. Crocker said the Afghans \"are very much in this fight trying to protect us.\" After the Interior Ministry shooting, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, said the United States would not let the incident divide the coalition.\n",
